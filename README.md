# The Curious Engineer’s Lab

Ever since I first cracked open a computer case, I knew I was hooked. Hardware, software, circuits, and code—every part of technology fascinated me. I wanted to understand how things worked, why they failed, and how to make them better.

Through trial and error, I’ve faced countless problems—buggy code, failing hardware, and complex architectures. But each challenge pushed me deeper into problem-solving. I explored open-source projects, built online tools, and contributed solutions that others might find useful.

This space is where I bring everything together—future tech, code snippets, troubleshooting insights, and discoveries that excite me. If you're just as curious, welcome aboard!
