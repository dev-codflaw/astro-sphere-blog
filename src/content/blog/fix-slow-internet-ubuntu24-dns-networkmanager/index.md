While the same network works fine on a MacBook Pro, Ubuntu 24 struggles due to slow DNS resolution. Since systemd-resolved is not available, the best solution is to update DNS settings using NetworkManager and configure Google DNS (8.8.8.8, 8.8.4.4).

# **Fixing Slow Internet on Ubuntu 24: Updating DNS with NetworkManager**  

## **üîç Problem: Slow Internet on Ubuntu 24, but Works Fine on MacBook Pro**  

Recently, I faced an issue where the **internet speed was slow and unreliable on my HP laptop running Ubuntu 24**, but the same internet connection worked **perfectly fine on my MacBook Pro**.  

### **Symptoms on Ubuntu 24 (HP Laptop)**  
- Websites **took too long to load**, especially **GitHub**, which either **failed to open** or loaded **very slowly**.  
- Other websites sometimes worked, but **performance was inconsistent**.  
- Speed tests showed normal internet speeds, but **DNS resolution was slow**.  

### **MacBook Pro (Same Network, No Issues)**  
On my **MacBook Pro**, everything worked **smoothly with no connectivity issues** on the same Wi-Fi or mobile hotspot.

### **Suspected Issue**  
The issue wasn‚Äôt with the internet speed itself but rather with **DNS resolution**‚Äîmeaning Ubuntu 24 was struggling to resolve website addresses quickly.  

Upon further troubleshooting, I found that **Ubuntu 24 does not use `systemd-resolved` by default**. Instead, **NetworkManager** handles the DNS settings, so fixing it required configuring **Google DNS through NetworkManager**.

---

## **üõ†Ô∏è Solution: Updating DNS Using NetworkManager**

Since `systemd-resolved` is **not available in Ubuntu 24**, I directly configured **Google DNS (8.8.8.8, 8.8.4.4)** using **NetworkManager**.

### **üîß Step 1: Identify Active Network Connection**  
First, I checked which network connection was active on my HP laptop (Ubuntu 24):

```bash
nmcli connection show --active
```

**Example Output:**
```
NAME         UUID                                  TYPE      DEVICE
Wi-Fi        12345-abcde-67890-fghij               wifi      wlan0
```
Here, `Wi-Fi` is my **active connection name**.

---

### **üîß Step 2: Update DNS to Google DNS (8.8.8.8, 8.8.4.4)**  

Next, I updated the DNS settings for my active connection using **NetworkManager**:

```bash
sudo nmcli connection modify "Wi-Fi" ipv4.dns "8.8.8.8 8.8.4.4"
sudo nmcli connection modify "Wi-Fi" ipv4.ignore-auto-dns yes
```

This forces Ubuntu **to bypass the default ISP-provided DNS** and use **Google DNS** instead.

---

### **üîß Step 3: Restart Network Connection**  
To apply the new DNS settings, I restarted the network:

```bash
sudo nmcli connection down "Wi-Fi" && sudo nmcli connection up "Wi-Fi"
```

---

### **‚úÖ Step 4: Verify the New DNS Settings**  
To ensure the DNS update was successful, I checked the DNS settings again:

```bash
nmcli device show | grep IP4.DNS
```

**Expected Output:**
```
IP4.DNS[1]: 8.8.8.8
IP4.DNS[2]: 8.8.4.4
```

This confirms that Ubuntu is now using **Google's DNS servers**.

---

### **üõ†Ô∏è Step 5: Testing DNS Resolution & Speed**
After applying the fix, I performed a **DNS lookup test** to verify that Ubuntu was using Google DNS properly:

```bash
dig google.com
```

**Output (Success ‚úÖ):**
```
;; SERVER: 8.8.8.8#53(8.8.8.8) (UDP)
```

This confirms that all DNS queries are now being resolved by **Google DNS**, rather than the slow ISP-provided DNS.

---

## **üöÄ Results & Improvements**
- ‚úÖ **GitHub and other websites now load instantly** without delays or failures.  
- ‚úÖ **Overall internet performance on Ubuntu 24 significantly improved.**  
- ‚úÖ **MacBook Pro and HP laptop now have similar browsing speeds.**  

---

## **üí° Conclusion**
If you're facing **slow internet on Ubuntu 24**‚Äîespecially with websites like **GitHub failing to load**‚Äîit could be a **DNS resolution issue** rather than a speed problem.  

Since **Ubuntu 24 does not use `systemd-resolved`**, the best way to fix it is to **update DNS settings through NetworkManager** and set it to **Google DNS (8.8.8.8, 8.8.4.4)**.

This method ensures a **faster, more stable, and reliable browsing experience** on Ubuntu.

---

### **üîπ Additional Notes**
- If you are using a **VPN**, make sure it doesn‚Äôt override your DNS settings.
- If the issue persists, you can try **disabling IPv6**:
  ```bash
  sudo sysctl -w net.ipv6.conf.all.disable_ipv6=1
  ```
